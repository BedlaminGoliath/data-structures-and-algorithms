## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The approach was really guided by what david did in class. I know this isnt the most difficult problem... but this process is very new and I hope to get better at it.

From my understanding the big o approach is accounting for what is taking place within this function and how it scales based on the input. The two main "actions" are whats being accounted for.
